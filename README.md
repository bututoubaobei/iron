<h3 align="center">The Iron Programming Language</h3>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ironlang/iron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ironlang/iron)

> Iron is a programming language that draws inspiration from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [Swift](https://swift.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It is a personal project that aims to help developers build scalable systems in a safe, expressive manner.

### Getting Started

You should be able to clone this repository and run the project with `cargo`. You will need LLVM installed and available on your PATH.

### Contributing

While this is currently more of a personal learning project, I welcome feedback and improvements through Issues and Pull Requests, respectively. All development is done on the `dev` branch; `master` reflects the latest stable release.
