> Iron is a programming language that draws inspiration from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [Swift](https://swift.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It is a personal project that aims to help developers build scalable systems in a safe, expressive manner.

### Design Philosophies

* Iron syntax should be expressive and easily approachable.
* The language should embrace and encourage functional programming paradigms.
* Documentation and testing should be first-class features.

### Getting Started

You should be able to clone this repository and run the project with `cargo`. You will need Rust and LLVM installed and available on your `PATH`.

### Contributing

While this is currently more of a personal learning project, I welcome feedback and improvements through Issues and Pull Requests, respectively. All development is done on the `dev` branch; `master` reflects the latest stable release.
